Click: A Pleasure to Write, a Pleasure to Use
=============================================

As developers, we spend a lot of time trying to automate task that we have to
carry out repeatedly. A likely result is a little (or not so little) command
line tool that supposedly makes our lives easier.

The Python standard library and as well as the wider community have come up
with a wide range of packages that make it easier and quicker to write a Python
script that can handle arguments and options.

My personal experience is that they are good, but not great... until I came
across click a tool written by Armin Ronacher. It's just beautiful to work with
and create simple, yet powerful, command line tools.

In this talk, I will take a look at the landscape of Python packages that help
building command line tools such as argparse and docopt. I will then introduce
click and illustrate some of the benefits over its alternatives before looking
at a concrete example to show some of its main features.
