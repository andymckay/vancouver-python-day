Open Source and You
===================

Open source is nothing if not communities, yet so much about our communities
are left to chance. Professional community managers are helping, but change,
especially cultural change, must be bottom up as much as it is top down.

In this talk we’ll look at open source web tech communities and see who gets
what right so we can all learn from them. We’ll finish by exploring what every
community member can do to shape and improve the communities to which they
belong.
