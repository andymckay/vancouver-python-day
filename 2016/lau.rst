The Highs and Lows of a Python Data Stack
=========================================

Many of you may have heard about NumPy, SciPy, and sklearn. Under the hood, a
lot of smartness which can be attributed by many different projects, and
languages. 

We shall traverse the Python Data (aka PyData) stack, from high level wrapper
with Jupyter notebook, down to the low level of optimization used in Numba to
translate python into LLVM to allow native execution. It will let you make
better use of Python as a numerical tool and preach more cool python to
others.
