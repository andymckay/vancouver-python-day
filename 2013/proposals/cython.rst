Optimizing Python Programs With Cython
--------------------------------------

Summary:

Python is a wonderfully expressive programming language, but has poor
performance in some scenarios. Luckily there are options for re-writing
performance-critical sections in more performant languages. In this talk, I'll
show how to profile and optimize a program that brute-force solves the
`15 Puzzle`_, with Cython_.


Intended audience:

Experienced developers, or new developers with a background in computer science
or software engineering.
