Python Doing Ocean Science
--------------------------

Summary:

Bloomcast is a daily prediction of the beginning of the aquatic growing season in the Strait of Georgia.
Python makes it possible by collecting meteorological and river flow data,
running a Fortran code,
analyzing its results,
and publishing the prediction to the web
- all while I sleep.


Longer description:

I'll talk about various ways in which I and others are using Python to help do oceanographic research.
The core of the talk will focus on Bloomcast
(http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~sallen/SoG-bloomcast/results.html)
which will soon be starting its 3rd year of predicting the date of the 1st sprint phytoplankton bloom in the Strait of Georgia.
There are a lot of nasty,
sharp bits involved in running a research Fortran code every day with real world data as inputs.
Python and a collection of its notable libraries allow that to be done painlessly, dependably,
repeatably,
and automatically.


Intended audience:

Intermediate developers,
Scientifically curious people
