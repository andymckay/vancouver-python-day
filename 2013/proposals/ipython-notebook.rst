iPython and the iPython notebook
----------

Summary:

iPython and the iPython Notebook are widely-used tools in scientific
data analysis. iPython is a shell that supports meta-commands
("magics") that simplify interacting with the OS and managing
data. The notebook is an interactive document format combining text,
equations, Python code, and output from that code. Together they
form a comfortable, powerful environment for analysing your data and
reporting your results.

Longer description:

This talk will provide basic skills that Lynne Williams will build
upon for her multitable analysis talk.

Intendened audience:

Scientists and engineers who work with data and Pythonistas who have
heard of iPython but not used it.

Given before?:

This will be a brand-new talk. It was inspired by an impromptu demo
that I gave to the Vancouver Python meetup in September.

About you:

Ted Kirkpatrick has taught computing science at three universities
over the course 17 years. He is currently interested in supporting the
computational needs of natural scientists, particularly in Python.
