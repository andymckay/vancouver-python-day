Scaling and Optimizing Python Apps in the Cloud
-----------------------------------------------

Summary:

A talk about best practices for scaling and optimizing your
python apps on a large scale.

Longer description:

Deploying and scaling web applications is a hard and painful process.
Aggregating your logs and inputting them into your favourite log
management tool can take hours. Optimization is a whole 'nother ball
game. Sometimes, it may not even be required! Why is this so hard?

In this talk, I'll be talking about some of the truths about scaling
your web application in production, along with some best practices,
tools, and techniques you can use to help you through this process.

Intendened audience:

Developers/System Administrators who are interested in the cloud or
are interested in learning how to scale (from a higher level point of view).

Given before?:

My coworker has given this talk before at PyCon 2013 in Santa Clara.

About you:

Hello! My name is Matt, and I am the Junior Product Manager at ActiveState_,
a software company based in downtown Vancouver. I only recently graduated
out of college, but I love to give talks about the stuff that I'm working
on. I also contribute to several open source projects in my spare time,
and I especially enjoy collaborating with people to help solve app
deployments, either on their own infrastructure or with someone else's.
I also have a blog at http://blog.bacongobbler.com/archive.html and you
