Speakers
========

Thank you for speaking. That's really awesome of you.

* Please be aware of our code of conduct. Don't be that person.

* Make you slides legible.

We'll have:

* A projector, some dongles for those pesky Macs.

* Wifi, but you know how that goes at talks, maybe best to assume it won't
  work.
