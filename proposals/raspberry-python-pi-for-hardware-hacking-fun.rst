How to build an internet radio with Python and Raspberry Pi.


Longer description:
===================

Powerful embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi made it feasible to use
high-level languages like Python for hardware hacking projects. That's
great because you'll get reasonable performance while working in your
favourite programming environment.

This talk summarizes my experiences with building an internet radio
based on the Raspberry Pi and tons of Python code. Things we'll cover
include:

    - A brief intro to the Raspberry Pi
    - Python on the Raspberry Pi
    - Drawing stuff on 128x64 LCD displays (UI primitives, font rendering, ...)
    - Optimizing Python code for low-level work
    - How to make a custom hardware case
    - Demo time
    - Why you should build something too

Hi, my name is Daniel. I’m a software engineer from Munich, Germany.
In early July, I moved to Vancouver — and so far I’m having a great time
cycling around False Creek and eating my own body weight in maple syrup.
I work at Mobify where I’m charming Pythons as a back-end engineer. Check
out my blog at http://dbader.org to see some of the things I'm working on.
