Longer description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Read the Docs has been hosting documentation for the Python community for over 3 years.
It's time that we do a little bit more.

So, in that spirit we have been working towards a "2.0" release that adds some fancy new things.
I will talk a bit about the history of Read the Docs, 
as well as show how some of the new interesting features that we've built work.

If everything goes according to plan, 
I might be able to launch the new version from the conference.
No promises,
but it should be shipping around the time of the conference.


Intendened audience
