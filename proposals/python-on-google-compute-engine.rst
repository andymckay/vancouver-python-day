Running your Python applications on Google Compute Engine
----------

Summary:

All the information you need to get started with Google Compute Engine and make architectural decisions for your Python applications. We’ll cover APIs, storage, networking (including load balancing), bootstrapping instances, and orchestrating resources from App Engine. There will be questions, answers, code and live demos.

Intendened audience:

Python developers who are interested in (or already) running applications in 'the cloud'.

Given before?:

Have you given this talk before, if so where. Are the slides already online?

I gave a version of this talk at PyCon APAC in September. http://goo.gl/oQ8luL

About you:

I aspire to awesomeness.

I’m a Developer Programs Engineer on the Google Developer Relations team. I help you build cool stuff with our APIs. I focus on our Cloud Platform, especially Compute Engine and Cloud Storage. I love Python and I’ve taught Python at the University of Washington & spoken at both PyCon US & PyCon Japan. I live in Seattle, WA, USA.
