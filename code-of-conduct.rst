Code of Conduct
===============

Be excellent to each other.

Short version
-------------

Vancouver Python Day is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.

All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.

Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for Vancouver Python Day.

Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

Long version
------------

This is basically the same as `Pycon <https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/>`_ and `DjangoCon <http://www.djangocon.us/about/conduct/>`_ policy.

If there's any issues contact Andy (778 968 3901) or Bryan immediately.
